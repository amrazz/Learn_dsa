"""
Types of Arrays on the basis of Memory Allocation:


1. Static Arrays:

In this type of array, memory is allocated at compile time
having a fixed size of it.We cannot alter or update the size of this array.
This type of memory allocation is also known as static or compile-time memory allocation.

2. Dynamic Arrays:

In this type of array, memory is allocated at run time but not having a fixed size.
Suppose, a user wants to declare any random size of an array, then we will not use a static array,
instead of that a dynamic array is used. This type of memory allocation is also known as dynamic or
run-time memory allocation.
